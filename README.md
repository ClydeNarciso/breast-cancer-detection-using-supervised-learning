### Automated Breast Cancer Detection through Binary Classification Using K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression... and working on SVM!

In this project, several supervised learning algorithms will be used in order to classify a sample as cancerous or not. 

The dataset used in this project contains numerical measurements of cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, and area, derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses, and labels of 'Benign' or 'Malignant'. The dataset source is the University of Wisconsin, provided through Kaggle.

We begin with data pre-processing and feature engineering to ensure clean, quality training and test datasets for our models. 
Then, we search for the optimal hyperparameters for our model to use. 
Finally, we evaluate model performance through Confusion Matrix analysis.

Join me as I engineer the features, tune the hyperparameters for optimal model performance, and evaluate model performance!
