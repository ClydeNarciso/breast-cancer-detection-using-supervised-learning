### Binary Classification of Breast Cancer Using K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression

In this project, I will be comparing the results of the two algorithms to classify the binary target variable indicating malignancy. I will be using Kaggle Notebook for all Python programming.

We have a dataset 'Breast_cancer_dataset.csv' containing features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses, and labels of 'Benign' or 'Malignant'.

Join me as I engineer the features, tune the hyperparameters for optimal model performance, and evaluate model performance!

**Now, go to the the .ipynb file above!**
