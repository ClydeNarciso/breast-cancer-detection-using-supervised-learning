### Automated Breast Cancer Detection through Binary Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and LinearSVC!
---
In this project, several supervised learning algorithms will be used in order to classify a sample as benign or malignant. 

The dataset used in this project contains numerical measurements of cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, and area, derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses, and labels of 'Benign' or 'Malignant'. The dataset source is the University of Wisconsin, provided through Kaggle.

The project will flow as follows:

1. We begin with data pre-processing and feature engineering to ensure clean, quality training and test datasets for our models

2. Then, we tune our hyperparameters for optimal performance through cross-validation techniques to avoid overfitting

3. Finally, we evaluate model performance through Confusion Matrix analysis

Join me as I engineer the features, tune the hyperparameters, and evaluate model performance! The code in this project is well-documented. Feel free to follow along!
